# Attack simulation
- We will perfom a controlled, local only attack simulation that will help us understand the mechanics of what we are learning

# !!IMPORTANT!!
     - WE ARE ATTACKING OUR OWN SERVER, ON LOCALHOST, NOTHING HERE IS DESTRUCTIVE AND SHOULD NOT BE USE TO DO SO

----

## Goal of this excercise
    - See how a server crashes or how it gets errors
    - Understand what caused it 
    - See what attackers look for 
    - Learn why defenses exist 

---

## Real-World Scenarion
- You deploy a Node.js server with:
    - No input validation 
    - No error handling
    - Open network binding 

- An Attacker:
    - Sends unexpected input
    - Looks for ways to crash your server
