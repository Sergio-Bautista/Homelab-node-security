This repository documents my hands-on learning building Node.sj services inside a home lab environment with a focuse on:

- Networking Fundamentals 
- Server Architecture 
- Security Threats and Mitigations 
- Real-World Troubleshooting 


## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn how backend servers work at the **network level**
- Build Node.js services that communicate over a local network (for now)
- Understand how requests flow between devices 
- Apply **security controls** (Logging, IP filtering, rate limiting)
- practice real-world debugging and documenting

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

This project focuses on:

- **Node.js & Express**
- REST APIs
- Middleware basics (IP addresses, ports, protocols)
- Reverse proxies (Nginx)
- Authentication & Authorization 
- Logging & Monitoring 
- Secure configuration & Threat awarness
